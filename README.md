## Known Bugs
Currently, there are no known bugs. Use of company owned laptops with stringent security controls can be a bottleneck. It is advisable to use an own laptop where you have full administrative rights

I have used HTML and CSS. Looking foward to do more fancy stuff with the same and other tools in future as i gain more experience.
